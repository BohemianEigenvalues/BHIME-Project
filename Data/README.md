#### charPolys4x4_d3.txt
This file contains information on the 8,739 distinct characteristic polynomials from the class of 4x4 matrices where the entries are either -1, 0 or 1. This class of matrices contains 43,046,721 unique matrices. Each line of this file is of the form `count, c3, c2, c1, c0` where `count` is the number of times the characteristic polynomial occurs in this class. `c0`, `c1`, `c2` and `c3` are the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial such that `charPoly = c0 + c1x + c2x^2 + c3x^3 + x^4`.

#### charPolys5x5_d3.txt
This file contains information on the 1,839,102 distinct characteristic polynomials from the class of 5x5 matrices where the entries are either -1, 0 or 1. This class of matrices contains 847,288,609,43 unique matrices. Each line of this file is of the form `count, c4, c3, c2, c1, c0` where `count` is the number of times the characteristic polynomial occurs in this class. `c0`, `c1`, `c2`, `c3` and `c4` are the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial such that `charPoly = c0 + c1x + c2x^2 + c3x^3 + c4x^4 + x^5`.
