#### charPolys1x1_d3.txt
This file contains information on the 3 distinct characteristic polynomials from the class of 1x1 matrices where the entries are either -1, 0 or 1. This class of matrices contains 3 unique matrices. Each line of this file is of the form `count, c0` where `count` is the number of times the characteristic polynomial occurs in this class. `c0` is the coefficient of the characteristic polynomial such that `charPoly = c0 + x`.


#### charPolys2x2_d3.txt
This file contains information on the 16 distinct characteristic polynomials from the class of 2x2 matrices where the entries are either -1, 0 or 1. This class of matrices contains 81 unique matrices. Each line of this file is of the form `count, c1, c0` where `count` is the number of times the characteristic polynomial occurs in this class. `c0` and `c1` are the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial such that `charPoly = c0 + c1x + x^2`.

#### charPolys3x3_d3.txt
